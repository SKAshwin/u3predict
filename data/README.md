CCSA.dta and ICSA.dta contain the continuing and initial claims (respectively) for each month for the reference week of the BLS Household Survey (the week containing the 12th), created via import_claims.do on the raw CCSA and ICSA data, setting weekdelay=0.

Similarly, CCSA_1wdelayed.dta and ICSA_1wdelayed.dta contain the continuing and initial claims for each month for the week *after* the reference week of the BLS Household Survey. Created via import_claims.do on the raw CCSA and ICSA data, setting weekdelay=1.

laborforce.dta contains the size of the labour force (in '000s) for every month. Produced as a result of make_merged_dataset.do.

unrate_claims.dta is the merged dataset of continuing claims, initial claims, the U3 unemployment rate and the labor force size, produced via make_merged_dataset.do, requiring that CCSA.dta, ICSA.dta and their 1wdelay versions have already been generated in the data folder.

final_model_data.dta contains the variables constructed for the purposes of the model - so the claims rate (which is (ICSA+CCSA)/labforcesize for each month), the delayed claims rate (same but using the 1wdelay data) and the unemployment rate and 12 lags of each.
