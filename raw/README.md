CLF16OV is the labor force size (measured in thousands), taken from: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLF16OV

U3 is measured using the household survey of the BLS, which uses as a reference week "the calendar week which includes the 12th". So we want to extract the continuing claims and new initial claims that also are for this calendar week.
